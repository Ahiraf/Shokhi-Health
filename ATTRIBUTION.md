# Sources, attribution & licences

Shokhi's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus (`lib/server/rag/sources/`) is built
**only from reliable, public, appropriately-licensed health sources**. The text in the
corpus is **summarised/adapted** into plain, low-literacy Bangla-first language; every RAG
answer in the app also shows the source of the passages it used. This is **general health
information, not a diagnosis**.

Shokhi is a **free, non-commercial** educational/hackathon project. No organisation's logo
is used, and no source endorses Shokhi.

## How to reuse / extend

Add a new source only if it is **reliable** (official health authority or peer-reviewed) and
its **licence permits reuse with attribution**. Put the `title`, `source`, `url` and
`license` in the `.md` frontmatter under `lib/server/rag/sources/`, then run
`npm run ingest`. Keep this file and the README references table up to date.
